## **Our Idea**
Our idea to use APIs is to create a program where you can list ingredients that you would like to have in your drink. Then our code would search through the API to find drinks that have the certain ingredients and print it out.  As we advance we would like our code to give you a recommended drink based on how you are feeling. This could be done by giving some ingredients a certain emotion.

## **Main Plan**
Trying to make a button when it is pressed then a random cocktail is shown and all of the ingredients is listed then we can use all those ingredients and make the cocktail ourselved to make a brewery game. 
These ingredients helps us make the game straightforward and get certain ingredients then printing it out. Once we figure this out we can make a bartender game.
