## **Our Idea**
Our idea to use APIs is to create a program where you can list ingredients that you would like to have in your drink. Then our code would search through the API to find drinks that have the certain ingredients and print it out.  As we advance we would like our code to give you a recommended drink based on how you are feeling. This could be done by giving some ingredients a certain emotion.
